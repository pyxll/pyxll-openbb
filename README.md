# Excel Bindings for OpenBB SDK

**Note** This requires v4 of the OpenBB SDK which is still in development.

This is a work in progress and will need updating as v4 of the OpenBB SDK evolves.

Excel bindings to the OpenBB SDK functions require PyXLL to be installed. Install
the PyXLL Excel add-in first and then pip install this package to add the OpenBB
SDK functions to Excel.

## Requirements

- PyXLL >= 5.6.4
- OpenBB SDK >= 4.0.0
